## Project Description
This project aims to analyze *What people like and
dislike about the Apps
in the Google Play
Store?* In this regard this project deals with the analysis of reviews from the Google Play Store that belong to the category communication. The techniques uses are:
1. Lexical dispersion plots (LDPs)
* Lexical dispersion is an technique to  identify “how are the use of words (lexemes) dispersed throughout the existence of a corpus.” They show the density of word usage throughout over the course of the wordcount of a speech event (for literary/linguistics scholars) or time."
2. Natural Language Processing using Python
* Analysis of users acceptance (polarity)
* Analysis of lexemes with wordclouds
* training a prediction model (RandonForestClassifier) that identify if a bulk of reviews contain positive or negative acceptance of the app.

## Hypotheses / Questions
* What people like and
dislike about the Apps
in the Google Play
Store?

To what extent the analysis of user reviews is accurate to identify
requirements, opinions and their
acceptance of the apps?

## Goals
1. Train a prediction model
user acceptance
2. Visualize common words
Requirements and opinions

## Dataset
* The Data set adquired with data minig from the website of Google Play Store from USA (scraping & Google-API)
* The sample contains 45.609 reviews posted between 2013-2021 and selected as the Most Relevant and the Newest.
* The Distribution of the reviews:
  * score 1: 8.659
 * score 2: 7.561
 * score 3: 14.222
 * score 4: 7.449
 * score 5: 7.718


## Conclusion
* Data do not tell about cultural, technological
and demographic conditions.
* NLP analysis of reviews do not provided what
exactly people like and dislike about an apps
* NLP analysis of reviews is a relevant
approach to:
 * identify the tendency of user acceptance
 * compare user acceptance in in relation to
others apps
  * characterize the preliminary needs of user
  * characterize the community of users in
Google Play Store
